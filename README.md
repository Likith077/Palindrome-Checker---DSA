# Palindrome Checker

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Files

- **`palindrome.html`**: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the web page.
- **`palindrome.css`**: The CSS file that styles the web page, ensuring a clean and modern look.
- **`palindrome.js`**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for checking if the input text is a palindrome.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input a word or phrase into a text box.
- **Palindrome Check**: Upon clicking the "Check" button, the application will determine if the input is a palindrome and display the result.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a clean layout and responsive design.

## How to Use

1. Open the `palindrome.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter a word or phrase into the text input field.
3. Click the "Check" button.
4. The result will be displayed below the input field, indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Code Highlights

- **HTML (`palindrome.html`)**: Contains the structure of the page, including an input field, a button, and a paragraph for displaying the result【7†source】.
- **CSS (`palindrome.css`)**: Styles the page with a centered container, styled input fields, and buttons for a modern look【8†source】.
- **JavaScript (`palindrome.js`)**: Handles the palindrome checking logic. It sanitizes the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters, converts the string to lowercase, and checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards【6†source】.

## Installation and Setup

No installation is required for this project. Simply download the files and open `palindrome.html` in any modern web browser.
